# ISR-of-Purkinje-cells

Here is the corresponding paper:
http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005000

The code shows the simulations of the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model (http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Adaptive_exponential_integrate-and-fire_model)
at different stimulus conditions. The parameters of the model were tuned to the Purkinje cell of cerebellum to reproduce the inhibiion
of these cells by noisy current injections. Similar experimental protocols were also applied to the detailed biophysical model of 
Purkinje cells, Bower-de-Shutter model. 

The repository also includes the XPPaut version of the model with the corresponding bifurcation analysis. If you have any troubles
with simulations, do not hesitate to let me know.
